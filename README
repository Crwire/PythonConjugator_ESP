+================================+

Originally this program was meant for me to understand programming and Spanish a little more, but now I've since become much better at Spanish and need to sharpen my programming skills.

+================================+
v1-2
Much more exciting, can take an 'ar', 'er' or 'ir' verb, conjugate it appropriately and append the correct person before.
Code has been cleaned and more appropriately encapsulated than before.

Still missing the latter conjugates after Nosotros.
v1-1
Bit more of an improvement, spits out the person now i.e. comer -> Yo como but is still hard coded.
v1-0
Doesn't do much, has some basic structures but does nothing more than print out a given verb conjugated in the "I" person i.e. comer -> como
